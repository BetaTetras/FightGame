A mini game in C++ that features a turn-based fantasy fight.

New Features:

	‣ The entire program is not in a single file; it is divided into specific files to help with debugging.

	‣ Added a structure system for storing different values and allowing the return of multiple variables.

	‣ Added the "object" system.

	‣ Added debug lines for checking the health status of each character. (There were some bugs with the health of the enemy 	and player; sometimes their HP would switch, but not anymore.)

New IG Features:

	‣ Added the object "Suspicious Potion" that can either heal or deal damage to the player.

	‣ Added the spell "Poisoned Sting" that deals 5 damage per round.

	‣ Changed the damage that a suspicious potion can deal from 20 HP to 10 HP. (Not worth if it can deal 20 HP of damage.)

Only the French version is available FOR NOW.
